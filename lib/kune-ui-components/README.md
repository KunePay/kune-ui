## What is this?

This project holds all Kune UI custom React.js components used to build Kune UI interfaces.

## Types of Components

There are two types of components:

### Element Components

Element components have no dependencies on other components and output a single UI element.

### Compound Components

Compound components either have dependencies on other components, output a single UI element made up of a group of components, or output a group of UI elements.

## Development

To begin development simply clone this repository, navigate to the directory's root, and run the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ npm install -g yarn
$ yarn
$ yarn setup:dev
$ yarn dev
```

## Dependencies

This project has dependencies on other `kune-ui` packages such as `kune-ui-utils`.

If you're setting up your development environment and you get an error due to missing dependencies, make sure you have cloned the entirety of `kune-ui` and that you are developing these projects under the `lib` directory.
