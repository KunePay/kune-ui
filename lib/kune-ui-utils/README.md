# Kune UI Utils

This is a zero dependencies node package.

In day-to-day web development, `utils` packages generally refer to self-contained functions which are very specialized in receiving a single input and returning a single output.

With this in mind, we decided to organize these functions by input type. So, for example, in order to find a function that transforms a string, simply look for it under the `string` directory.
